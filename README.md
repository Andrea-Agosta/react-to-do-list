# React.js To-do list

This is my *"To-do list"* web application project.
I did this project for the Udemy course [The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

This application allowed you to add and remove a new item in your to-do list.

### Technology used:
This is my first React.js project.

### Run the application in local environment

After the `git clone` of the project, cd in to project root folder.

In the terminal run the following commands
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
The website is available on [localhost 3000](http://localhost:3000)
